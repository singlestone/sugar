## Installation

Inside the Sugar monorepo, install it with a dev dependency like so:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@singlestone/tailwind-theme-sugar": "workspace:^"
  }
}
```

Outside the monorepo, install it with an actual version instead of `workspace:^`.

## Usage

```typescript
import { theme } from "@singlestone/tailwind-theme-sugar";
```
